👋 Hello, viewer!

Welcome to the **Step 1** folder of my [Striver's A2Z DSA Sheet](https://takeuforward.org/interviews/strivers-dsa-sheet-top-coding-interview-problems/) journey!  
I’ve tried my best to follow the original structure of the sheet so things stay clean, consistent, and **easy to navigate** ✅

---

## 🧭 What's in this folder?

This folder contains my solutions and notes for **Step 1 – Learn the Basics**, which includes important foundational topics in C++ (or whichever language you’re using).  
While I haven’t solved **every** single problem, I’ve handpicked and included the **most essential ones** — the ones that really **strengthen your fundamentals** before diving deeper into DSA. 💡

---

## 📚 Topics Covered

🔹 Input/Output  
🔹 Conditional Statements  
🔹 Loops  
🔹 Basic Pattern Printing  
🔹 Functions  
🔹 STL Basics *(Coming soon)*

These are all the key building blocks you should know when starting your DSA prep in **any** language! 🔧

---

## 🧠 Why this matters?

Think of this as your **quick revision zone** – a place to sharpen your logic and syntax before getting into the heavier DSA stuff like arrays, recursion, sorting, and so on.  
Trust me, if you're **comfortable here**, the next steps will feel way smoother! 😎
