/* In this particular folder i will be listing some questions and their solutions in c++ code.
   I would highly advise to find the striver's A2Z DSA list if you do not have the paid subscription.
   The  questiom list is available on codolio for free with the corresponding question on different platforms.
   In all the questions, the function is provided by the editor you just need to write the logic of the code, 
   not the main function. input will be provided for 

   Question 1: Sum of Array Elements 
   Given an array arr of size n, the task is to find the sum of all the elements in the array.

code:
*/

class Solution{
public:
	int sum(int arr[], int n) {  
        //linear search 
        int sum = 0;   //declaring the variable to add each element of array
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        {   // iterating through the array
            sum = sum + arr[i];
        }  
        return sum;
	}
};
